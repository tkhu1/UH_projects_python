Mr. Moran,

My agent is 6 feet tall and has short dark hair. He will be wearing a red fedora hat and holding a yellow umbrella. You are meeting him in London, so I suggest that you also take an umbrella.

When you approach him, say the secret phrase that I attached to confirm your identity. 

To evade the detectives, I have encrypted both the secret phrase (cipher4A.bin) and the exact location of the meeting (cipher4B.bin) using AES in CTR mode. For both, I again used our very secure key. 

Sincerely,
Professor Moriarty

p.s.: I have attached the secret phrase in plaintext as well since it is imperative that you successfully identify yourself to my agent.
