Mr. Moran,

Execute theft tonight. Once you have the diamond, follow my instructions for the exchange.

To protect the secrecy of our plan, I have encrypted my instructions. You may decrypt the ciphertext using the following information:
- encryption is AES in CBC mode without any padding;
- key is 128 bits long, value of the first key byte is 1, second key byte is 2, third key byte is 3, fourth key byte is 4, and so on;
- IV is 16 zero bytes;
- use the class SecretKeySpec to set the key for the cipher (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/spec/SecretKeySpec.html);
- use the class IvParameterSpec to set the IV for the cipher (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/spec/IvParameterSpec.html).

Sincerely,
Prof. M
