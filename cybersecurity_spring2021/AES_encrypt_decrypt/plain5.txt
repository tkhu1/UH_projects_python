"The location is St. Pancras railway station. Sincerely, Professor Moriarty"

When you discover the location of the meeting, you immediately notify Inspector Lestrade. He and Inspector Bradstreet assemble a team of detectives and rush to the railway station. They arrive just in time to arrest both Moriarty's agent and Mr. Moran. Unfortunately, the dastardly Professor Moriarty once again escapes. He is truly the Napoleon of crime. Nonetheless, the detectives recover the Koh-i-Noor diamond and return it to the Tower of London. Dr. Watson turns to you and says: "Excellent cryptanalysis!" to which you reply "Elementary, my dear Watson."
